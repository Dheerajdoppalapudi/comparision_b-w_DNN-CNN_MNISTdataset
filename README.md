This is the comparity study on convolution neural networks and depp neural networks on fashion mnist dataset. This data set contains training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. 

we can achive more accuracy on training and testing dataset using convolutional neural networks than deep neural networds. there are multiple reason are there to justify that cnn are better that dnn while classifing images.

The below picture shows a CNN sequence to classify a handwritten digit.

Here's an example of how the data looks when plotted.
